# Alphabet Soup Deep Learning Model Report

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model to predict the success of funding applications submitted to Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation. By analyzing historical application data, we aim to build a model that can classify applications as successful or unsuccessful, enabling the foundation to make informed funding decisions.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
- **Target Variable:**
  - `IS_SUCCESSFUL`: This binary variable indicates whether a funding application was successful (1) or not (0).

- **Feature Variables:**
  - All other columns, excluding the target variable and irrelevant identifiers, serve as input features for the model. These include categorical features such as `APPLICATION_TYPE`, `CLASSIFICATION`, `USE_CASE`, and numerical features.

- **Removed Variables:**
  - `EIN` and `NAME` were removed as they are non-beneficial identifiers that do not contribute to the prediction task.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- **Neural Network Architecture:**
  - **Input Layer:** Accepts the preprocessed feature set.
  - **Hidden Layers:**
    - First hidden layer: 80 neurons, ReLU activation function.
    - Second hidden layer: 30 neurons, ReLU activation function.
  - **Output Layer:**
    - 1 neuron with a sigmoid activation function to produce a binary classification outcome.

- **Model Performance:**
  - The model was trained over 50 epochs with a batch size of 32.
  - After evaluation on the test dataset, the model achieved:
    - **Loss:** (value from model evaluation)
    - **Accuracy:** (value from model evaluation)

- **Steps Taken to Improve Model Performance:**
  - Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables.
  - Used `StandardScaler` for feature normalization.
  - Adjusted the number of neurons and layers to find an optimal balance between complexity and performance.
  - Experimented with different activation functions (ReLU for hidden layers, sigmoid for output layer).
  - Tuned hyperparameters such as epochs and batch size.

## Summary
The deep learning model demonstrated moderate predictive performance for classifying funding applications. However, the accuracy may not be sufficient for practical implementation.
